# Attack Phase

# Footprinting

The objective _**of Footprinting:-**_

- **Learn Security posture:** Analyze the target’s security posture, find loopholes, and create an attack plan.
- **Identify focus area:** Using different tools and techniques, narrow down the range of IP addresses.
- **Find vulnerabilities:** Use the collected information to identify the target’s security weaknesses.
- **Map the network:** Graphically represent the target’s network and use it as a guide during the attack.
